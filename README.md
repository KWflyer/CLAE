# How to use the code                                    
=====================================

Running Environment: Windows 7, Matlab R2014b

Source data: 
1. Case Western Reserve University(CWRU) bearing dataset:
   http://csegroups.case.edu/bearingdatacenter/pages/download-data-file.

Source code:
Reproduce the experimental results on CWRU dataset:
1. Download the CWRU dataset from    
   http://csegroups.case.edu/bearingdatacenter/pages/download-data-file
   In our experiments, the used CWRU data are saved as the file "Sample_12k_Drive_End_Bearing_Fault_Data_DE.mat", which could not be uploaded due to the capacity limitation of Github. 
2. Run the following .m files in the file "Run" to reproduce the reported results. <br>
         -- *.m     <br>
         -- *.m     <br>
         -- *.m  <br>
         -- *.m      <br>
         -- *.m   <br>
3. The file "Experimental_Results" includes the experimental results of our paper.
