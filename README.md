Source code:
Reproduce the experimental results on CWRU dataset:
1. Your can download the the source CWRU dataset from  
   http://csegroups.case.edu/bearingdatacenter/pages/download-data-file <br>
   In our experiments, the used CWRU data are also saved as the Matlab file "Sample_multi_array.mat", which are shared at **Baidu**        **Netdisk**: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Lo7PUV_AETrrMqhHNmr7zA, due to the capacity limitation of Github. <br>
   You can freely download this data file.
2. Run the following .m files in the file "Run" to reproduce the reported results. <br>
         -- *.m     <br>
         -- *.m     <br>
         -- *.m  <br>
         -- *.m      <br>
         -- *.m   <br>
3. The file "Experimental_Results" includes the experimental results of our paper.
